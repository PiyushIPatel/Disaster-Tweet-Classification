![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/076f33c1-d322-479e-a6b2-b260f7f5aa82)

An advanced machine learning model to classify disaster-related tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction, and implementing a neural network for accurate tweet classification. Applied techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Achieved high accuracy and recall, making the model suitable for real-time disaster monitoring. Future improvements include integrating transformer models (BERT, GPT-3) and implementing a real-time tweet tracking system using the Twitter API.
